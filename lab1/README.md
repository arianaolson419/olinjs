#Lab 1: WikiApp - Constructing a Wiki
You must construct a wikipedia-like clone using React. You should program the app using the conventions, styles, and functionality of React. It should have the following functionality:
- Topic pages with title and content
- A list of all available pages
- Allow users to submit new pages on topics
- Allow users to edit existing pages
- Documentation for each major component (Minimum of few sentences at top of every file)
- Not look terrible
- One other feature you'd like to implement (anything from a random page button to images or html within content, or even a search bar. It's up to you to be creative!)

If you want to make the wiki have a special topic area (like harry potter or some game) you are encouraged to do so.
Brownie points will be awarded for awesome looking websites whose themes match the topic area, though having all the functionallity should come before making it pretty.
