Do not merge this pull request! It is just for me to add my feedback on your Cat App.

Homework Feedback for Cat App:

Functionality:
 - Completion: Almost all of your features work. The /cats route displays a list of cats sorted by age, the /cats/new route adds a new cat, and the /bycolor/:color route displays only the cats that are that color. The /cats/delete/old route does delete a cat but it is not always the oldest cat. (20/20)
 - Bug Free: The /cats/delete/old route does not always delete the oldest cat. I put some comments in routes/index.js for you that fix the bug. Technically, you are deleting the oldest cat you created, which is the first element in the array, but not the oldest cat by age, which was your intention. I would also put some more work into thinking on edge cases, so that the server does not return a type error when you try and delete a cat when the cats array is empty. (7.5/10)

Quality:
 - Good Coding Practices: I liked that you bundled all of your route functions into an object called routes and then exported it, with your helper functions defined above in index.js. You could even put those helper functions in another file and then export an object with those functions, as you did with routes. Other than the syntax errors in the bug I found, your code looks good with variable names that are clear and good comments. (10/10)
 - Readability: Functions and variables are named well with good comments. Remove the files that you aren't actually using in your application. (10/10)

Nice work!
